small house to work with :)

Please do not re-post or upload to workshop, but besides that, you can mess around with it however you want.

to get the map working, you have to go to your downloads (or wherever you keep ph_Punyhouse) unzip the folder, and run the .bsp file. If it comes up with a prompt asking you what you wanna run the file with click "chose an app from your computer" then locate the garry's mod .exe file and click open. it should work.

if you wnat me to post a tutorial on my yt then just ask in comments.
