# gm_punyHouse
small house to work with :)

Please do not re-post or upload to workshop, but besides that, you can mess around with it however you want.

To get the map on gmod just put the ph_PunyHouse file inside of "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons" then, if garry's mod is open close it, re-open it a gain, and that should work.
